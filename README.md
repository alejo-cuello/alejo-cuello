# Welcome to my GitHub Profile

## 👋 Hi, I'm Alejo

I'm an Information Systems Engineer from Argentina, currently focused on becoming a Data Scientist.

## 🔁 Career Transition

For several years, I worked as a Mobile Developer and Business Analyst, participating in projects using a wide range of technologies. I’ve built mobile apps, managed projects, and helped teams deliver high-quality software.

Today, I’m fully focused on Data Science, combining my technical background with new skills in data analysis, statistics, and machine learning to solve real-world problems using data.

## 🎯 What I’m Doing Now
- Studying Data Science through multiple courses on Platzi
- Working on personal projects involving data wrangling, analysis, and visualization
 Practicing with tools like Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-learn
- Sharing what I learn through code and notebooks in public repositories
